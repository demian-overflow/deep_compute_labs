# Visualizations

This repo includes a simple educational visualization for array algorithms.

- Route: `/daily-temperatures`
- Purpose: step through the stack-based "Next Warmer Day" algorithm

Run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# then open http://localhost:3000/daily-temperatures
```

The visualization allows editing input temperatures (comma-separated), stepping forward/back, auto-play, and observing the stack and result array updates.
